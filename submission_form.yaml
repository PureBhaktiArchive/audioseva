    	<li>While digitizing, multiple recordings on one side of the cassette merge together into one audio file. When you hear the audio, if you notice that there are various lectures with different themes/ dates/ locations etc. in the same audio file, then such an audio
    		file is to be treated as a Fused lecture. If this is the case, choose ‘Yes’ in this field. Otherwise please choose ‘No’.</li>
    	<li>Details for each individual recording in the same audio file are to be filled separately in a new form. In such cases, please fill the same Online Submission Form link again, after you press the submit button.</li>
    	<li>For example, suppose an audio file given to you has two lectures fused in it: first one from 00:00 to 30:20 and the next from 31:00 to 46:00. Then please choose ‘Yes’ in this field and write the beginning and ending timings of each lecture in Field C.
    		(In this case 00:00 – 30:20, in the first form) Then mention all the details from 00:00 – 30:20 in the first form and submit it. Once you submit, you will be directed to another page with a confirmation message like this:
        <div class="center-block alert alert-success text-center">
          <p><strong>Thank you! We have received your submission.&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p><strong>For fused lectures, please click the button below to submit the next lecture within the same audio file.</strong></p>
          <div class="btn btn-primary">Make another submission for fused lectures</div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>To fill the details of the next fused lecture in the same audio file, click the button- ‘Make another submission for fused lecture’. You will now be directed to a new submission form with the same audio file name pre-filled, along with your name and email id. Start over again, on the same form, which would now have the same audio file name, with all the other fields blank. Choose ‘Yes’ again for Fused lectures and mention the timings in field C as
        31:00 – 46:00. Then, in all the remaining fields in this form, mention the details of the lecture from 31:00 – 46:00.</li>
