<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Over the years more than 10000 lectures of Srila Gurudeva were recorded.</p>

<p>Some disciples (diksa and siksa) of Srila Gurudeva have laboriously collected and diligently digitized thousands of
  lecture-cassettes recently. Since the recording, especially in the earlier years, was not undertaken systematically,
  multiple challenges remain to be tackled in the archives, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Undated lectures</li>
  <li>Fused lectures (Multiple lectures recorded on a single two-sided tape, now digitized into a single audio file)</li>
  <li>Lectures recorded simultaneously by different devotees giving rise to duplicates</li>
  <li>Impaired sound quality due to background noise, low volume, and so on</li>
  <li>Lectures interspersed with kirtanas, announcements, long pauses, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p><b>To systematically organize the archives (audio &amp; video) of Srila Gurudeva.</b></p>

<p>This archive will help in various ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To organize and title all lectures.</li>
  <li>To clean up the audio files (for sound quality and content) and the database of duplicates.</li>
  <li>For the Publication Team, this database will facilitate referencing for future publications/periodicals.</li>
  <li>To have a hard drive containing Srila Gurudeva’s hari-katha with the best quality, adequately titled and
    organized for easy navigation with minimum duplicates. This hard drive will be available to all devotees.</li>
</ul>

<p>This exercise will eventually translate into more hari-katha being released in the future in the form of quotes,
  articles, lecture transcriptions and books as well as organized, clearer audio files and easy access to all the
  recordings for devotees in general. These files will be uploaded on the internet to be viewed, listened and
  downloaded by interested devotees.</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>

<p>All the lectures recorded on tapes have now been digitized and a master list has been created by assigning each
  audio file a unique serial number.</p>

<p>Now the exercise involves gradually titling and sorting the lectures by making a synopsis of their contents using
  the Online Submission Form, which is very easy for all and doesn’t necessitate access to a computer. In fact, the
  entire seva can be done using a smartphone.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">Note: If there is no response after the lectures are sent, the Audio Seva
  Team will send notifications requesting a status update. If, for some reason, there is still no response, after a
  period of 30 days (since the lectures were allocated), they will automatically be re-allotted to another devotee.</div>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;">Guidelines to fill the Online Submission Form</h2>

    the Online Submission Form for that lecture and indicate which language the allotted lecture is in. We will then
    allot you new lectures.</li>
  <li>Guidelines for filling the fields of the form have been detailed out below in the 'Fields' Section. They have
    also been included under each field in a drop down link called ‘Guidelines’ for your easy reference.</li>
  <li>Once you fill in the details and click 'Submit', Audio Seva team will automatically get the information.</li>
  <li>Please note that some fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required, and submission will not take place if they
    left blank.</li>
  <li>After filling the details, click ‘Submit’. If after clicking submit, the next page doesn’t appear, it means that
    some required field is not updated. In that case, such fields will be highlighted. Please check all the fields
    again and click Submit.</li>
  <li>When you start out the first time, please wait for us to respond with feedback after your first submission, to
    ensure that we are on the same page. Then, after receiving inputs, you can continue to complete the allocated
    lectures.</li>
  <li>Please submit details for ALL files allocated to you, even if they are empty, corrupt, irrelevant, inaudible,
    etc. Please include comments about such files in the ‘Comments’ field (#O). This will help us clean up the database
    of unnecessary files.</li>
  <li>If among a series of lectures allotted to you, you find that some are duplicates, with minor alterations, please
    mention your comments in the last column for each file with any relevant information about the file such as ‘Sound
    quality improved’, ‘abrupt ending’, ‘casual talk deleted’, etc. and your recommendation on which file should be
    retained. If the other information is the same, you may simply leave those fields blank for that lecture. Please
    hear each file allotted to you from beginning to end and fill out the details. This will help us to identify the
    best quality audio, while sorting duplicates.</li>
  <li>If you are unsure about a particular detail, but feel it is important to mention, please put a question mark (?)
    at the end of the entry.</li>
  <li>If a specific detail is unavailable, please leave the field blank. But remember, that any detail could help the
    overall effort!</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Tip: It might be convenient for some devotees to note the lecture details
  for each field on paper first, while hearing the lecture and then enter into the Online Submission Form.</div>

<h3>Fields</h3>

<h4>A. Audio File Name</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Generally, this field will be pre-filled in the form. But in exceptional cases, if it isn’t, please copy and
    paste the original audio file name, exactly as it is received from the Audio Seva Team by email.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fused-lectures">B. Fused Lectures</h4>

<ul>
  <li>While digitizing, multiple recordings on one side of the cassette merge together into one audio file. When you
    hear the audio, if you notice that there are various lectures with different themes/ dates/ locations etc. in the
    same audio file, then such an audio file is to be treated as a Fused lecture. If this is the case, choose ‘Yes’ in
    this field. Otherwise please choose ‘No’.</li>
  <li>Details for each individual recording in the same audio file are to be filled separately in a new form. In such
    cases, please fill the same Online Submission Form link again, after you press the submit button.</li>
  <li>For example, suppose an audio file given to you has two lectures fused in it: first one from 00:00 to 30:20 and
    the next from 31:00 to 46:00. Then please choose ‘Yes’ in this field and write the beginning and ending timings of
    each lecture in Field C. (In this case 00:00 – 30:20, in the first form) Then mention all the details from 00:00 –
    30:20 in the first form and submit it. Once you submit, you will be directed to another page with a confirmation
    message like this:
    <div class="center-block alert alert-success text-center">
      <p><strong>Thank you! We have received your submission.&nbsp;</strong></p>

      <p><strong>For fused lectures, please click the button below to submit the next lecture within the same audio
          file.</strong></p>

      <div class="btn btn-primary">Make another submission for fused lectures</div>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>To fill the details of the next fused lecture in the same audio file, click the button- ‘Make another submission
    for fused lecture’. You will now be directed to a new submission form with the same audio file name pre-filled,
    along with your name and email id. Start over again, on the same form, which would now have the same audio file
    name, with all the other fields blank. Choose ‘Yes’ again for Fused lectures and mention the timings in field C as
    31:00 – 46:00. Then, in all the remaining fields in this form, mention the details of the lecture from 31:00 –
    46:00.</li>
</ul>

<h4>C. Timing (Only for fused lectures)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Please note that this field needs to be filled ONLY in the case of Fused lectures.</li>
  <li>Please write the timing when the new lecture begins and ends in min:sec or hr:min:sec format, as applicable.</li>
  <li>This will help the Audio Seva Team to separate the individual lectures and archive them with appropriate
    labeling.</li>
</ul>

<h4>D. Date</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This is taken from the original file name OR from the lecture. Please maintain YYYY-MM-DD format.</li>
  <li>Please write the date of the recording if it can be obtained by hearing. For example, at the end of the lecture,
    some devotee might announce the date or the tithi (lunar day such as ekadasi, pratipata, etc. or special day such
    as Janmastami, Gaura Purnima, etc.)</li>
  <li>If you are unsure of the date, please put a ‘?’ after the suggestion.</li>
  <li>In the case that the date is missing, if any tithi is alluded to in the lecture, please mention it here, as it
    might help us to arrive at a date by backward calculation. For instance: Srila Gurudeva might say, “Tomorrow is
    Govardhan Annakuta. We will have a festival…” Then please mention ‘Tomorrow is Govardhan Annakuta’ here.</li>
  <li>This field is crucial for organizing the archive as well as identifying duplicates, so any information provided
    here may help.</li>
</ul>

<h4>E. Location</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Please specify any information that indicates a place of the recording.</li>
  <li>Write the name of the city here. If the city is not known, write the country name here.</li>
