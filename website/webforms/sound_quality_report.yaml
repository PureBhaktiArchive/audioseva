    Please rate the overall sound quality of the allotted file by selecting one of the options: Good, Average, Bad. The basis of rating will be the audibility of Srila Gurudeva’s voice. In other words, if you find it difficult or strenuous to understand what Srila Gurudeva is speaking, due to too much background noise or volume being too low and so on, please choose ‘Bad’. On the other hand, if the audio is clear, with no background noise and good volume, please choose ‘Good.’ In cases where you can hear Srila Gurudeva well but there is some sound issue also, choose ‘Average’. This will help us decide which SE to allot the file to.
  "#options":
    Good: "<b>Good</b> - You can hear Srila Gurudeva clearly with very little or no disturbance"
    Average: "<b>Average</b> - Srila Gurudeva can be heard clearly but there are background noises or the volumn is low"
    Bad: "<b>Bad</b> - You can hear Srila Gurudeva but need to strain because of either very low volume, or too much background noise, constant distractions, etc"
    Inaudible: "<b>Entire file is Inaudible</b> - You can make out that there is some recording but cannot hear anything clearly"
    Blank: "<b>Entire file is Blank</b> - There is no sound at all or just irrelevant sound (like someone forgot to stop recording)"

        Here, we simply want to know how much the tape has relevant recording. In other words, whether any part of the sound file is blank or inaudible and hence to be discarded. Usually such parts are present towards the end of the file. There might be small parts 5-7 min long in between two lecture recordings, but these can be ignored. Please write the beginning and ending timings of the overall recording in this field in (h:)mm:ss format.
